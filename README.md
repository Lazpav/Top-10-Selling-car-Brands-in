Implement Animated Bar Chart for Top Car Brands with Sales Data

- Processed car brand sales data from an Excel file and restructured it into a DataFrame.
- Created an animated bar chart that visualizes the top 10 car brands by sales for each year.
- Implemented the display of brand logos next to the bars using OffsetImage and AnnotationBbox.
- Included error handling for loading logos and adjusted animation speed.
- Currently figuring out how to properly align and display logos on the chart. 

Help Request: I'm having trouble getting the brand logos to appear correctly in the animated bar chart. The logos are sometimes misaligned or not showing as expected. Any suggestions on how to better integrate logos into the chart would be greatly appreciated!
